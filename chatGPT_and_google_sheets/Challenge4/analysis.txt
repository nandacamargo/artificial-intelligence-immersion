A token is around 4 characters of text.

If we pick 'inputs.txt' and ask to tokenize, we would get 9 tokens for input 1 and 5 tokens for input 2.

When picking 'outputs.txt' and asking to tokenize, we get 415 tokens for output 1 and 141 for output 2.

If we need to use an API, the cost considers the number of tokens.
It is important to know that when doing this via API, we are paying for the current input + the history before. So for input 2, we are paying again for input 1 + output 1. That is why it is important to formulate well the inputs.

Prices are per 1000 tokens and if we use 8k context model, the prices are:

Input               Output
$0.03 / 1K tokens	$0.06 / 1K tokens
