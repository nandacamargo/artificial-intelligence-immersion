==================
My Detailed Prompt
==================

I would like you to calculate income taxes and to provide me the sum of all taxes. 
If someone receives:
- Until R$20.000,00 this person pays 10% of tax; 
- Between R$20.000,00 and R$30.000,00 pay 20% of tax;
- Between R$30.000,00 and R$40.000,00 pay 20% of tax;
- Finally, people with income more than R$40.000,00 pay 30%.

Note that Brazilian Real follows this format: R$xx.xxx,xx or R$xxx.xxx,xx. For example, R$10.000,00 and R$123.546,00.

I'll give you two examples:

------------------------------------
Example 1
------------------------------------
Salary, Tax
R$12.000,00 -> 10% (R$1.200,00 )
R$21.000,00 -> 20% (R$4.200,00 )
R$33.000,00 -> 20% (R$ 6.600,00 )
R$82.000,00 -> 30% (R$ 24.600,00 )

Expected answer:
Partial tax = [1.200, 4.200,  6.600, 24.600]
Total tax:  R$36.600,00 (sum of each partial tax)
=========================================
------------------------------------
Example 2
------------------------------------
Salary, Tax
R$5.000,00 -> 10% (R$500,00 )
R$25.000,00 -> 20% (R$5.000,00 )
R$28.000,00 -> 20% (R$ 5.600,00 )
R$100.00,00 -> 30% (R$ 30.000,00)

Expected answer:
Partial tax: [500, 5.000, 5.600, 30.000]
Total tax:   R$41.100,00
=========================================

Given the rules and the examples above, calculate the total tax to be collected for the following yearly salaries:

Input:
R$31.000,00
R$15.000,00
R$52.000,00
R$103.000,00
R$42.000,00
R$156.000,00
R$15.000,00
R$27.000,00
R$82.000,00
R$33.000,00
R$25.000,00
R$17.000,00
R$53.000,00
R$35.000,00
R$120.000,00
R$74.000,00
R$28.000,00
R$64.000,00
R$29.000,00
R$14.000,00

Expected answer is:

Notes about ChatGPT Answer
===========================================================
The partial tax amounts were correctly calculated. 
However, the total amount was incorrect. That is why 
there is another file "prompt_part2" to elaborate more 
the question and finally provide the correct resulting sum.
