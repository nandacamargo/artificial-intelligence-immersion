## Calculate Tax with ChatGPT using Chain-of-Thought

Given the following values:

R$31.000,00
R$15.000,00
R$52.000,00
R$103.000,00
R$42.000,00
R$156.000,00
R$15.000,00
R$27.000,00
R$82.000,00
R$33.000,00
R$25.000,00
R$17.000,00
R$53.000,00
R$35.000,00
R$120.000,00
R$74.000,00
R$28.000,00
R$64.000,00
R$29.000,00
R$14.000,00

Use Chain-of-Thought method in ChatGPT to calculate the tax amount to
be paid. If someone receives until R$20.000,00, this person pays 10% of tax; people who receive between R$20.000,00 and R$40.000,00 pay 20% of tax. Finally, people with income more than R$40.000,00 pay 30%.
This is just a fictitious example, so the provided values and the taxes are only for learning/experimental purposes.
